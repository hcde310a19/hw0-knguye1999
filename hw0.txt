# Description of your program (part 7)
1. Open the document up by calling the file name
2. assign a name to 0 and this will be the number returned after counting the number of words in a file
3. Create a loop to each each line and use .split() to create a list of words from that line
4. Use the length (len()) function to count the number of items in the list created
5. Add that length number to the assigned name
6. Return & print the assigned name that has been the counter

# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)
It was easier than I thought because I took CSE 160, I did need a quick refresher on the different functions
I learned in that class by looking at the notes I took. I found the split function in my notes and remembered that
it would be useful to break down a file with words into a list, then all I had to do was find the length of
the list. I know that the description I gave would not be that simple because I didn't account for different characters
that are not words. It is satisfying writing an english translation of what my code would do because I totally
forgot structure.
